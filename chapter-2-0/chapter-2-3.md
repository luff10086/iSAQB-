# chapter 2 3

Hi â€” I don't see any content yet. Please paste the web page URL or the page HTML/Markdown you'd like converted for GitBook, and I'll:

* Preserve all links (including query parameters).
* Remove navigation/header/footer noise.
* Convert ordered multi-step lists into a stepper.
* Convert npm/yarn/pnpm blocks into a tabs block if detected.
* Turn FAQs into expandable blocks.
* Use GitBook advanced blocks (tabs, stepper, hint, expandable, etc.) where appropriate.

If you have any special preferences (e.g., keep images as-is, include code block titles), mention them.
